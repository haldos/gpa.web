<h1 class="title">Computer aided music performance analysis by means of pitch contours representation</h1>


<h2 class="title">Description</h2>
<p>
This work deals with computer aided analysis of music performance from audio recordings. An existing computational method for the representation of pitch contours is briefly reviewed. Its application to music analysis is exemplified with two pieces of non-notated music: a field recording of a folkloric form of polyphonic singing and a commercial recording by a noted blues musician. Both examples have vocal parts exhibiting complex pitch evolution, difficult to analyse and notate with precision using Western common music notation. By using non-traditional time-frequency analysis techniques that improve the location of the components of a complex sound, the melodic content representation implemented here allows a detailed study of aspects related to pitch intonation and tuning. This in turn permits an objective measurement of essential musical characteristics that are difficult or impossible to properly evaluate by subjective perception alone, and which are often not accounted for in traditional musicological analysis. Two software tools are released that allow the practical use of the described methods.

<h2 class="title">Vamp Plugin</h2>
<p>
We have implemented a plugin that can be used with the audio analysis software called <a href="http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/" target="blank">Sonic Visualiser</a>. This plugin implements the calculation of the Fan Chirp transform applied to the analysis of polyphonic music. This technique, based on the decomposition of the audio signal in harmonics "chirps", results in a representation of the pitch prominence, called F0gram.

<h2 class="title">Matlab GUI Tool</h2>

<p>
A Matlab GUI tool was developed for the detailed exploration of the F0gram. The music performance analysis carried out in this work was done using this tool, as well as with the Sonic Visualiser plugin.
</p>
<p>
The tool includes additional features for assisted labeling of pitch contours. It could be employed for example, for creating annotated music databases to train and evaluate algorithms intended for melody and multiple fundamental frequency detection.

<h2 class="title">Examples</h2>

<p>
In order to exemplify the application of the techniques described in the paper to musicological analysis, we have selected two pieces of non-notated music, both of them with vocal parts exhibiting complex pitch evolution, very difficult or downright impossible to notate with precision using Western common music notation: a field recording of a folkloric female vocal trio from the Shope region in West-Central Bulgaria, and a commercial recording by noted blues singer and guitarist Muddy Waters.

Example 2: Diaphonic chant of the Shope country (click to enlarge)<br>
One phrase of the Harvest Song, showing characteristic traits of Shopi diaphonic singing: the second part moving
from sub-tonic to tonic, and melodic ornamentation in the first part, including tresene and a final izvikvane in unison.<br>
